As a Bioinformatics manager of the TechDev unit, Mathieu ensures the
integration and the support of new genomics technologies in the platform, and
he leads the software development. Prior to joining C3G, Mathieu was the
team leader of the Bioinformatics service unit at Genome Quebec. He holds a
PhD in Statistical Genetics from University Paris-Sud XI and a Master degree
in Genetics from University Pierre-et-Marie-Currie (Paris VI).

Dr. Simpson develops algorithms and software for the analysis of
high-throughput sequencing data. He is interested in de novo assembly and
the detection of sequence variation in individuals, cancers and populations,
with a focus on long read sequencing technologies. Dr. Simpson developed
the ABYSS, SGA and nanopolish software packages.

#### Robert Syme

After completing a postdoctoral position in Australia, Rob joins the team as a
Bioinformatics consultant specialising in fungal/plant genetics and developing
omics resources, strategies, and infrastructure for laboratories working with
non-model organisms. He has more than a decade of experience working in
genomics, and holds a PhD in bioinformatics from Curtin University.

#### Daniel Poppleton

Daniel recently joined the C3G after completion of a post-doctoral
fellowship on mammalian genomics at the Royal Veterinary College in
London. He previously worked on bacterial genetics and microbiomes
during his doctorate at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Currently, he
contributes through the development of pipelines and the processing of
raw data with the team.

Francis was one of the co-founders of the CBW in 1998. His teams over
the years have been involved in the development of DNA, RNA and
protein sequences analysis methods, as well as the development of
platforms to integrate data from various open databases. Since July 2021 Francis is the
Executive Director of the Neuro Bioinformatics Core Facility and the TOSI Open Science Officer,
both positions at McGill University.
