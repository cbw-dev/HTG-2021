## Lab

*Created by Mathieu Bourgey, Ph.D*

#### Introduction

This workshop will show you how to launch individual first steps of a DNA-Seq pipeline

We will be working on a 1000 genome sample, NA12878. You can find the whole raw data on the 1000 genome website: [http://www.1000genomes.org/data](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data)

NA12878 is the child of the trio while NA12891 and NA12892 are her parents.
